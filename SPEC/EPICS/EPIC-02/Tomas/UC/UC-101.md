## Use Case: Admin Management and Monitoring

**Use Case ID:** UC-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 16/10/2025
**Last Updated:** 16/10/2025
**Priority:** `High`
**Status:** `Draft`

**Primary Actor:** Admin
**Secondary Actors:** Data Server, Authentication Service
**Stakeholders:**
- **Admin:** wants to efficiently manage users and monitor employee data
- **Company Management:** wants up-to-date insights on employee workload and locations
- **IT/Security Team:** requires secure authentication and data handling

**Brief Description:**  
This use case describes how an admin securely accesses the Admin Platform, manages users, monitors working hours and locations, and checks system connectivity. The goal is to ensure secure, efficient, and accurate administrative operations.

**Trigger:**  
The admin wants to log in to the Admin Platform to manage users or view work data.

**Preconditions:**  
- The admin has valid login credentials  
- The Admin Platform is accessible  
- A connection to the Data Server is available

**Postconditions:**
- The admin is authenticated and has access to dashboards
- User and work data is displayed accurately and up-to-date
- Changes to users or data are immediately applied
- Data server connection status is visible

### Main Success Scenario

| Step | Actor Action | System Response |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | Admin opens the Admin Platform | System displays the login form |
| 2 | Admin enters username and password | System verifies credentials and securely transmits data |
| 3 | Admin is authenticated | System redirects admin to the dashboard |
| 4 | Admin selects "Employee Overview" | System displays a list of all employees, their working hours, and current/last locations |
| 5 | Admin filters by date or employee | System updates the view dynamically |
| 6 | Admin selects "View Charts" | System displays dynamic bar/pie charts of total hours per location |
| 7 | Admin adds or removes a user | System opens the user management form, validates input, executes changes, and confirms |
| 8 | Admin checks data server connection | System displays status (green = connected, red = disconnected) and warns if server is unreachable |

### Extensions (Alternative Flows)

**2a. Invalid Login**
- **Condition:** Admin provides incorrect credentials
- **Action:** System shows an error message and logs the attempt
- **Result:** Admin can try logging in again

**5a. No Data for Filter**
- **Condition:** Selected filter returns no results
- **Action:** System shows "No data available"
- **Result:** Admin can adjust the filter or reset view

**7a. User Management Error**
- **Condition:** Duplicate or invalid input when adding a user
- **Action:** System displays an error and does not apply changes
- **Result:** Admin corrects the input

**8a. Data Server Unreachable**
- **Condition:** Ping to the server fails
- **Action:** System shows a warning and marks status as red
- **Result:** Admin is informed

### Special Requirements

**Performance:**
- Dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- Filter updates respond within 1 second

**Security:**
- HTTPS for all connections
- Passwords stored securely
- JWT-based authentication
- Session timeout after inactivity

**Reliability:**
- System availability 99.5%
- Data server connection failures should be handled correctly

**Technical Constraints:**
- Integration with Data Server via REST Controller
- Responsive for desktop and tablet devices
- Chart rendering using d3.js for instance

### Open Issues
- Define exact session timeout duration
- Detailed role and permission management for user administration
