## Epic Overview

**Business Problem:**

Currently managing working hours always requires each employee to have additional hardware (badge system, need of a computer, ...) or they still write all their working hours in a paper format.

In order to solve this issue, he have decided to implement a mobile application software that would allow us all employees to use their personal phones in order to book all their working hours.

**Business Value:**

The software eliminates the need for additional hardware and digitalizes the entry of working hours, improving efficiency and avoiding trickery.

**Success Metrics:**
- Metric 1: Being able to add hours into the system by no more that 5 button actions
- Metric 2: Support all platforms
- Metric 3: [Still to continue]

## Scope

### In Scope
- Build an intuitive, easy-to-use mobile application
- Send localization and timings of the user to the data server
- Make attractive design for employees

### Out of Scope
- Application integrated into company car software
- Fully automated service (by entering a certain location with your device)
