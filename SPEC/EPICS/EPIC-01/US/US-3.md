**As a(n)** Employee,

**So that** the system may log the end of my shift accurately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Getting to "End Shift" button should take no more than 3 clicks.
- [ ] The application indicates clearly that the shift has ended.

**Technical Notes:**
- Button sizes should be considerably large to take gloves and thicker fingers into consideration.
