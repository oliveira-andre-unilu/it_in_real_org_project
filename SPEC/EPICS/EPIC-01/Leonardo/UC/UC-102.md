## Use Case: Employee Shift Punch-in (Start Shift)

**Use Case ID:** UC-102  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 19/10/2025  
**Last Updated:** 19/10/2025  
**Priority:** <!-- `Critical` | --> `High` <!-- | `Medium` | `Low` -->  
**Status:** `Draft` <!-- | `Reviewed` | `Approved` | `Implemented` -->

**Primary Actor:**
- Employee (Application User)

**Secondary Actors:**
- Employer
- Team Leader
- Management

**Stakeholders:**
- Company

**Brief Description:**
This use case describes how an employee stops logging their working hours by using a "End Shift" function in the mobile application.  
The process records the current timestamp and the GPS location (Car GPS in the future) of the user. This data is sent to the central server after the end of a shift or as soon as there is a stable internet connection (in case of connectivity issue).  
This feature ensures accurate time and location tracking and minimizes manual input or reporting errors.

**Trigger:**
The user opens the mobile application and in no more than 3 taps, presses "End Shift" button to stop recording their working hours.

**Preconditions:**
- The user must be already logged into their account in the application.
- The application must have the appropriate permissions to access time and location data of the device and time servers (critical to prevent time manipulation).
- The server or local storage must be available to record the shift end data.

**Postconditions:**
- The system successfully records the shift end timestamp and GPS coordinates.
- The data is stored on the central (or queued locally for later synchronization).
- The applications displays a confirmation that the shift has ended.
- The total hours worked are calculated (slightly rounded up) and displayed to the user.
- The shift entry is marked as completed in the database.

### Main Success Scenario

| Step | Actor Action | System Response |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | User opens the mobile application. | The application loads the home/dashboard screen. |
| 2 (Optional) | User navigates to shifts of a specific site/location. | The application loads a screen with a "End Shift" button for the specific site/location. |
| 3 | User taps the "End Shift" button. | The system validates that an active shift exists for the user. |
| 4 | | The system records the current timestamp and GPS coordinates. |
| 5 | | The system stores the data in the local database and/or sends it to the central server. |
| 6 | | The application displays a confirmation message (example: "Shift ended at 15:28. Total hours worked: 7 h 56 min"). |
| 7 | User taps "Ok" on the confirmation message. | The application updates the UI to show "Start Shift" once again. |

### Extensions (Alternative Flows)

**2a. No Internet Connection**
- **Condition:** The application cannot reach the central server.
- **Action:** The system stores the shift end data locally.
- **Result:** Data will be automatically synced once the device reconnects to the internet.

**3a. User Cancels Confirmation**
- **Condition:** User presses "Cancel" in the confirmation dialog.
- **Action:** The system aborts the operation.
- **Result:** The shift remains active and the recorded shift end data is wiped.

**4a. GPS unavailable**
- **Condition:** The phone's GPS is disabled or unavailable.
- **Action:** The system records the timestamp only and logs a "Location Missing" flag or return location as "null".
- **Result:** The shift still ends successfully, but with a warning message.

**5a. No Active Shift Found**  
*NOTE: This should probably never occur but safety fallbacks should still be implemented!*
- **Condition:** User attempts to end a shift when none is active.
- **Action:** The application displays an error (example: "No active shift to end").
- **Result:** Action terminates without recording any data.

### Special Requirements
**Performance:**
- End-of-shift confirmation and processing should complete **within 3 seconds**.
- The "End Shift" button should be accessible within **3 taps or fewer** from the launch of the application.

**Security:**
- User authentication via secure credentials or company SSO.
- Shift data must be encrypted during transmission.

**Reliability:**
- System should handle temporary network outages by caching data locally.
- The application should automatically retry synchronization when connection is restored.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Mobile app must be compatible with Android at launch (iOS can be released at a later stage).
- Integration of GPS should keep vehicle tracking system in mind.

### Open Issues
- Should location tracking be mandatory or optional due to privacy concerns?
- How will unsuccessful shift end be handled when the user performs the actions correctly but there is a failure in the system? (Suggestion: Have a fixed amount of hours for the shift of each employee (usually 8 hours). Once 8 hours have passed, end shift automatically.)
- Should the confirmation dialog include additional notes or comments (e.g., "Reason for early departure")?
