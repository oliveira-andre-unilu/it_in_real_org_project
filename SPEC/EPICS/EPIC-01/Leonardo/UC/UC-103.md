## Use Case: Employee Reminder

**Use Case ID:** UC-103  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 19/10/2025  
**Last Updated:** 19/10/2025  
**Priority:** <!-- `Critical` | `High` | `Medium` | --> `Low`   
**Status:** `Draft` <!-- | `Reviewed` | `Approved` | `Implemented` -->

**Primary Actor:**
- Employee (Application User)

**Secondary Actors:**
- Employer
- Team Leader
- Management

**Stakeholders:**
- Company

**Brief Description:**
This use case describes how the mobile app automatically reminds an employee to start or end their shift if they have forgotten to do so.  
At scheduled times before or after the expected shift start and end times, the system checks for missing punch-in our punch-out entries and triggers a notification to prompt the user to take action.  
This helps maintain accurate work-hour tracking and reduces administrative corrections.

**Trigger:**
User manually configures one or more reminder times in the application settings.

**Preconditions:**
- The user must be already logged into their account in the application.
- The application must have the appropriate permissions to access system time.
- Push notifications must be enabled for the application.
- There must be at least one shift available to associate with the reminder.

**Postconditions:**
- User receives a notification at the configured times before or after the expected shift start or end times.
- User can open the application directly from the notification to start or end the shift (Suggestion: If possible implement a "Start Shift" and "End Shift" option directly to the notification. This avoids user even opening the application.).

### Main Success Scenario

| Step | Actor Action | System Response |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | User configures a reminder for his shift (e.g., 5 min before shift starts). | The application saves this reminder into its configuration files. |
| 2 | | The application sends a push notification at defined time (e.g., "Your shift starts in 5 minutes"). |
| 3 | User opens the notification on their device. | The notification provides direct action buttons (e.g., "Start Shift" or "Open App"). |
| 4a | User taps the notification. | The application opens directly to "Start Shift" or "End Shift" button screen. |
| or |
| 4b | User uses direct notification buttons to start or end shift. | System updates shift status (records data) and notification disappears |


### Extensions (Alternative Flows)

**2a. Notifications Disabled by User**
- **Condition:** The user has disabled notifications on their device (or specifically for this application).
- **Action:** The application logs that reminders cannot be sent.
- **Result:** No notification is displayed.

**3a. Shift Already Started or Ended**  
*NOTE: In case reminders are set for after shift actions.*
- **Condition:** The user already took the required action before the reminder time.
- **Action:** The system cancels or suppresses the reminder.
- **Result:** No notification sent.

**4a. Device Off or Do Not Disturb Mode On**
- **Condition:** The user's device is off or in “Do Not Disturb” mode.
- **Action:** The notification is queued and sent once conditions allow.
- **Result:** Employee receives the notification later, with correct timestamp.

### Special Requirements
**Performance:**
- Notifications must be delivered on time or at the very least **within 30 seconds of expected time**.

**Security:**
- Notification must not display sensitive data (only generic text such as "Shift Start Reminder").

**Reliability:**
- Reminder service should retry failed deliveries up to 3 times.
- Missed notifications (notification not sent to user) must be logged for later review.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Requires knowledge handling background scheduling API (Android WorkManager or iOS BackgroundTasks)

### Open Issues
- Should employer be able to create a reminder which cannot be turned off?
- Should the application include recurring reminders (alert user that shift should have already started or ended)?
