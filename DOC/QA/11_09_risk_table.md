| Regulatory non-compliance (GDPR)                             | The system can expose sensible data (name, ID, hire date) without respecting GDPR.  | High, legal risk and reputation risk                         | We can either accept this risk because our project will not be public, or we can try to add compliant measures (hahsing) |
| Data Privacy                                                 | A user see sensible data, but he doesn’t have the rights to see these. | High, legal risk and reputation risk                         | We need to decide which type of user can see what type of information and then implement these. Or accept this risk. |
| Incorrect data, not-updated, missing                         | The represented data (shifts, working hours, employees assigned to a working place, working place details, etc…) are not synchronized correctly because of a bug, a failure,  | High                                                         | We accept it for the moment                                         |
| Insufficient log retention (for activity log UC-12)          | Logs expire too soon or are not archived                     | Low                                                          | Apply the right parameters (choose the right time to keep activity logs) |
| Modification conflict                                        | Two administrators modify the same data at the same time.<br>Overwriting of modifications, inconsistency between assignments. | High                                                         | When development, think of concurrent modification to prevent this risk |
| No validation prior to major modification (add, remove, edit a user or a working place) | No confirmation before modification or deletion.<br>Risk of irreversible human error. | High                                                         | Implement a validation system, a message (“Are you sure you want to…”) |

| Authentication service unavailable                           | Admin can no longer access their account, critical operations blocked. | High, service interruption                                   | Accept this risk.                                            |
| Unauthorized access, security failure                         | A compromised admin account, or a password leak that allow access to the system. | High, GDPR sanctions, data breaches, manipulation of sensitive information | Use security measures (multi-factor authentication, strong password, etc…) |
