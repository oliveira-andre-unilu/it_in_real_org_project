\subsection{Final Conclusion}\label{final-conclusion}

\subsubsection{Project overview}\label{project-overview}

The Timelink project was carried out through a structured development
process that covered the full software lifecycle. The main deliverables
included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Brainstorming and idea definition
\item
  Specification and requirements analysis
\item
  Software architecture design
\item
  UI mockups and blueprint creation
\item
  Back-end development
\item
  Front-end (mobile) development
\end{itemize}

This approach allowed the team to progress from concept to a functional
prototype in a controlled and iterative manner.

  of concept
\item
  A solid and extensible codebase established for future development
\item
  Functional foundations in place for:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Security and authentication
  \item
    Back-end data handling
  \item
    Mobile front-end user experience
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Challenges and
resolutions}\label{challenges-and-resolutions}

Several challenges were encountered during development:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Part of the initial scope had to be reduced to ensure timely delivery
\item
  Defining a compliant and feasible architecture required multiple
  iterations
\item
  Team members had to learn and adapt to new programming languages and
  technologies
\item
  Early design definitions were sometimes lacking, requiring later
  adjustments
\end{itemize}

These challenges were addressed through prioritization, continuous
discussion, and iterative improvements.

\item
  Integration and usage of Swagger / OpenAPI for backend communication
\item
  Better understanding of the differences between React Native and React
\end{itemize}

\textbf{General outcomes:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Improved task management and individual responsibility
\item
  Enhanced teamwork and collaboration through coordinated development
  and testing efforts
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\subsubsection{Lessons learned}\label{lessons-learned}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Design phases should be emphasized more and specified in greater
  detail
\item
  Testing should be introduced earlier in the development process
\item
  Scope creep should be avoided, and contingencies should always be
  planned for unexpected issues
\end{itemize}

Overall, the project provided valuable technical and organizational
learning experiences while delivering a working prototype of the
Timelink system.
