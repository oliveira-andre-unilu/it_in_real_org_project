## Final Conclusion

### Project overview

The Timelink project was carried out through a structured development process that covered the full software lifecycle. The main deliverables included:

* Brainstorming and idea definition
* Specification and requirements analysis
* Software architecture design
* UI mockups and blueprint creation
* Back-end development
* Front-end (mobile) development

This approach allowed the team to progress from concept to a functional prototype in a controlled and iterative manner.

### Results and highlights

* Delivery of **Timelink Prototype Version 1**, serving as a proof of concept
* A solid and extensible codebase established for future development
* Functional foundations in place for:

  * Security and authentication
  * Back-end data handling
  * Mobile front-end user experience

---

### Challenges and resolutions

Several challenges were encountered during development:

* Part of the initial scope had to be reduced to ensure timely delivery
* Defining a compliant and feasible architecture required multiple iterations
* Team members had to learn and adapt to new programming languages and technologies
* Early design definitions were sometimes lacking, requiring later adjustments

These challenges were addressed through prioritization, continuous discussion, and iterative improvements.

---

### Positive outcomes

**Technical outcomes:**

* Hands-on experience with Expo and React Native
* Integration and usage of Swagger / OpenAPI for backend communication
* Better understanding of the differences between React Native and React

**General outcomes:**

* Improved task management and individual responsibility
* Enhanced teamwork and collaboration through coordinated development and testing efforts

---

### Lessons learned

* Design phases should be emphasized more and specified in greater detail
* Testing should be introduced earlier in the development process
* Scope creep should be avoided, and contingencies should always be planned for unexpected issues

Overall, the project provided valuable technical and organizational learning experiences while delivering a working prototype of the Timelink system.
