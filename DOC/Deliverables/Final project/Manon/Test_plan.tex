\section{QA Test Plan}\label{qa-test-plan}}

\hypertarget{objective}{%
\subsection{Objective}\label{objective}}

The objective of this test plan is to validate the functional quality,
the reliability, and security of the employee shift management
application, based on the results of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  manual tests
\item
  unit tests
\item
  integration tests and based on the risks identified in the Risk
  Register.
\end{itemize}

This plan aims to ensure that critical features are operational and that
the main risks are either covered by testing or explicitly accepted.

\hypertarget{scope-of-testing}{%
\subsection{Scope of Testing}\label{scope-of-testing}}

\hypertarget{features-tested}{%
\subsubsection{Features tested}\label{features-tested}}

The tests cover the following use cases:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  UC-1: Monitor Employee Shift

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Viewing working hours
  \item
    Managing default periods
  \item
    Cases where no data is available
  \end{itemize}
\item
  UC-2: Start a Shift

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Starting online/offline
  \item
    GPS management
  \end{itemize}
\item
  UC-3: End a Shift

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ending a shift online
  \item
    Ending a shift offline (partially tested)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  UC-4: Employee Reminder

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Sending notifications
  \item
    Redirection from the notification
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Backend testing covers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  business services (Employee, Project, Timestamp, Customer, Auth),
\item
  security and authorization rules,
\item
  exceptions and data validation,
\item
  controller integration testing (partially executed).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{out-of-scope}{%
\subsubsection{Out of scope}\label{out-of-scope}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Large-scale performance
\item
  Load testing
\item
  Full regulatory compliance (GDPR)
\item
  Advanced competition management (multi-admin)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{testing-strategy}{%
\subsection{Testing strategy}\label{testing-strategy}}

\hypertarget{types-of-tests}{%
\subsubsection{Types of tests}\label{types-of-tests}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Manual functional tests
\item
  Unit tests
\item
  Integration tests
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{risk-based-prioritization}{%
\subsubsection{Risk-based
prioritization}\label{risk-based-prioritization}}

The following features are considered critical:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Start and end of shift (UC-2, UC-3)
\item
  Access rights management (Auth, Employee, Admin)
\item
  Working time data integrity
\end{itemize}

The following features are secondary:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Notifications (UC-4)
\item
  Offline management of shift end
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

The test plan shows that the application is functionally stable for its
main uses.\\
Critical features have been validated, and identified risks are either
covered by testing or clearly accepted with full knowledge of the
facts.\\
However, improvements are needed in notification management, offline
shift, and compliance rules before large-scale deployment.
