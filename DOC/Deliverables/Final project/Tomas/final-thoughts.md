## Challenges and Resolution
- There were no major issues on my end. Everything went relatively smoothly during the project.

## Positive Outcomes / Lessons Learned

### Technical
- **Expo and React Native:** I gained practical experience setting up a proper Expo React Native application. Expo is a framework and platform for React Native that simplifies the development process by providing tools, libraries, and services for building apps quickly without worrying about native code. It allows for faster prototyping, easier deployment, and seamless integration with devices and simulators.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI Integration:** I learned how to integrate Swagger/OpenAPI for proper API documentation, which ensures that backend endpoints are clearly defined and easily testable.
- **React Native vs React:** I got to know the differences between React (web development) and React Native (mobile development). While React focuses on building web interfaces using HTML and CSS, React Native allows building mobile apps with native components, providing a closer-to-native experience on iOS and Android.

### General / Personal
- I improved my ability to follow project tasks and manage my own contributions efficiently, such as keeping track of issues and handling data consistently.
- My teamwork and collaboration skills developed further through coordinating with team members.
