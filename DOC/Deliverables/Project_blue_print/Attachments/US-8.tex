\textbf{Status:} \texttt{Backlog}

\textbf{As a} admin \textbf{I want to} add and remove users from the
system \textbf{So that} I can manage access and maintain an up-to-date
user list

\textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} - {[} {]} Admin can create a new user with
role and credentials - {[} {]} Admin can deactivate or delete existing
users - {[} {]} Changes are reflected immediately in the system - {[}
{]} Confirmation dialog appears before user removal

\textbf{Technical Notes:} - Implement CRUD endpoints for user management
- Validate inputs and handle duplicate user entries - Ensure role-based
access control
