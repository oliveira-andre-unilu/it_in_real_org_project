\subsubsection{US-103: As an admin, I want to see graphs of total hours
worked per working
place}\label{us-103-as-an-admin-i-want-to-see-graphs-of-total-hours-worked-per-working-place}

\textbf{Status:} \texttt{Backlog}

\textbf{As a} admin \textbf{I want to} see visual representations of
total working hours per location \textbf{So that} I can easily analyze
workload distribution

\textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} - {[} {]} Admin can view bar or pie charts
of total hours per working place - {[} {]} Charts update dynamically
when filters change - {[} {]} Data source matches what is displayed in
the working hours overview

\textbf{Technical Notes:} - Use a chart library (e.g.~d3.js) - Ensure
responsiveness for desktop and tablet views

\textbf{Estimate:} 4-5 Story Points \textbf{Priority:} \texttt{Medium}
