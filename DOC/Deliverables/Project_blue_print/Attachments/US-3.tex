\subsubsection{03: Employee Shift Punch-out (End
Shift)}\label{employee-shift-punch-out-end-shift}

\textbf{Status:} \texttt{Backlog}

\textbf{As a(n)} Employee,\\
\textbf{I want to} end my shift by pressing a ``End Shift'' button in
the application,\\
\textbf{So that} the system may log the end of my shift accurately.

\textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} - {[} {]} The app prompts a confirmation
before ending a shift. - {[} {]} Getting to ``End Shift'' button should
take no more than 3 clicks. - {[} {]} The application indicates clearly
that the shift has ended. - {[} {]} Upon ending a shift, the total hours
worked are shown.

\textbf{Technical Notes:} - Button sizes should be considerably large to
take gloves and thicker fingers into consideration.

\textbf{Estimate:} 2 Story Points\\
\textbf{Priority:} \texttt{High}
