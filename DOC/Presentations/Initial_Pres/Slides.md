## Project goals

The main goals of this application are the following:

- Having an easy User interface for the mobile app, this specially since the application would be used by different types of users.

- The mobile app shall be independent of the Data Server. The users shall be able to add working schedules without any internet connection and, when the do have som internet connection, the data should be uploaded into the main server.

- The main Data server does not need to have any UI (apart from a PHPAdmin page eventually) and shall always guarantee a fast connection for all users.

- The administrator page shall will eventually have a more complex interface but it needs to several graphs that will demonstrate all the admin needs in a easy and direct way.

- All the other goals will be specified more specifically in the SPEC sheet
